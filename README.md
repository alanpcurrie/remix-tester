This command uses Remix with Vite to build your application.

## Running in Production

To run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

This uses `remix-serve` to run your built application.

## Deployment

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`:
- `build/server`
- `build/client`

### Choosing a Host

You'll need to pick a host to deploy your application. Remix is compatible with many hosting providers. Check the Remix documentation for specific deployment guides.

## Additional Tools

- **Biome**: Used for linting and formatting
- **Vitest**: Used for unit testing
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking
- **Vite**: Used as the build tool and development server

## Customisation
